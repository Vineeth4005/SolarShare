Solar generation estimation — converts a raw NASA POWER GHI reading into
SolarShare's estimated electrical generation figure.

============================================================================
FORMULA AND UNIT CONVERSION (see app/integrations/nasa_power.py module
docstring for the full unit-verification writeup this depends on)
============================================================================

Input: `allsky_sfc_sw_dwn` — hourly average GHI in W/m^2 (verified against
NASA POWER's own Hourly API docs + pvlib's NASA POWER client mapping).

Step 1 — convert to kWh/m^2 for the hour:
    ghi_kwh_per_m2 = ghi_w_per_m2 / 1000

    (An average power of X W/m^2 sustained for exactly 1 hour delivers
    X Wh/m^2 of energy; dividing by 1000 expresses this in kWh/m^2. Because
    PV systems are RATED in kW at the Standard Test Condition irradiance of
    1000 W/m^2 = 1 kW/m^2, this kWh/m^2 figure is numerically equivalent to
    "hours of full-intensity sun" for that hour — the standard input to
    capacity-based PV estimation formulas.)

Step 2 — apply the generation formula (MODEL B, locked as of the Phase 2
solar-generation-model review):
    estimated_kwh = ghi_kwh_per_m2 * capacity_kw * performance_ratio

MODEL B RATIONALE (why PV efficiency is NOT a multiplier here): `capacity_kw`
is the STANDARD INDUSTRY MEANING of "PV system capacity" — the system's
rated electrical output at Standard Test Conditions, i.e. the number that
appears on a vendor spec sheet, a tender document, or a grid interconnection
agreement. Module efficiency is *already baked into* how that STC rating was
derived (panel efficiency x panel area x panel count = rated kW), so
re-applying `efficiency` as a second multiplier here would double-count that
loss and understate generation (a 500 kW system would appear to only ever
produce like a 100 kW system at full sun). `performance_ratio` alone is
responsible for capturing *additional*, real-world derating on top of the
STC rating (temperature, wiring, inverter, soiling, mismatch losses) — this
is the same structure as the widely-used PVWatts-style simplified estimator:
    Energy = Rated Capacity x (Incident Irradiance / STC Irradiance) x PR

PV module efficiency (`PVConfig.efficiency`, e.g. 0.20 / 20%) is retained in
configuration as DESCRIPTIVE METADATA ONLY — it documents how the rated
capacity is physically achieved (panel technology, approximate area implied
by that efficiency at that capacity) and is useful for realism/UI/judge
questions about installation footprint. It is deliberately NOT read by this
calculation.

Previously implemented model (superseded — kept here only as a historical
note, not in effect): an earlier version of this module additionally
multiplied by `efficiency`, treating `capacity_kw` as a pre-efficiency
theoretical maximum rather than the STC-rated output. That formulation was
reviewed, found to be physically inconsistent with how "500 kW PV capacity"
is used industry-wide, and replaced with Model B above.

This remains a documented SIMPLIFICATION, not a full physical PV simulation
(no temperature derating curve, shading, degradation, or inverter-efficiency
curve modeling) — consistent with the locked specification's requirement
that the system "must not falsely claim that this is a complete physical
photovoltaic simulation."
